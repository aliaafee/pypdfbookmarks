# PyPDF Bookmarks
An interactive python shell for conveniently editing the bookmarks tree of a PDF document.

I originally made this because there was no good simple, free tool for this task. The only free one I could find was 'JPdfBookmarks', but it kept crashing with the files I was using.

This uses PyPDF2 for reading and writing PDF documents.
